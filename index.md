**Lock-in+PID** is an application for the [RedPitaya](https://redpitaya.com/) enviroment / STEMlab 125-14 board
that implements an Oscilloscope application and a Lock-in amplifier. It's based on
[relese-0.95 scope application](https://github.com/RedPitaya/RedPitaya/tree/release-v0.95/apps-free/scope)
of the RedPitaya project.

The aim of this application is to provide a toolkit for labs measurements and system control uses.
The functionalities are organized in ["instruments"](TheApp/instruments/instruments_01_intro/).

## Publication
A rigorous description of the App design and applications can be find in this article on scientific journal:
*Compact embedded device for lock-in measurements and experiment active control*.

**News:** There is a new section on this web page about ["derivated works"](Derivated), including applications
for Red Pitaya that are similar in design to `Lock-in+PID` or that are useful complements:
  - Harmonic (only) Lock-in, with some extra features
  - Peak simulator App, to simulate the spectral response of a system under scan/locking
  - Third-party projects inspired in `Lock-in+PID`

## Where to start

If you want to know more about how to use this app you should read the
[TheApp > Instruments](TheApp/instruments/instruments_01_intro/) menu.


## Download and install

For the last release, check [TheApp/install/](TheApp/install/). The application
comes in three flavors: **Default**, **DEBUG** and **RELOAD**. You'll be looking
probably for the Default option.

## Use cases

The application implements a lock-in amplifier and two PID filters. These elements
are suitable for several stabilization schemes implementations: they measure
low amplitude signals to get a physical system state and then use a
closed-loop feedback system to stabilize the state of the physical system to a desired one.

The closed-loop system is an stabilization-scheme, usually descrived in
[control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory). The actually probed schemes
are mostly from laser-optics applications, because **Lock-in+PID** was created in
an optics lab with this purpose. But all off then are ready to use in any physical
system o engineering project controlled by electric signals.

### Lock-in+PID most common usage

**Phase sensitive measurement of small signals**

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert" markdown="1" >
Implementation of the lock-in technique to measure the response of a system
under and oscillatory excitation. If you use an excitation signal of frequency *f*
(reference signal),
the system response will have also a *f* Fourier component. With the lock-in technique
you can filter the *f* component and measure its amplitude and phase relation with
the reference signal. The filtering process enables you to reduce the noise signal from
the other frequencies components and amplify the response one, enhancing the
signal-to-noise ratio. We call this process *demodulation*. Also, you can demodulate
the input signal using *2f* and *3f* frequencies to get harmonic components that
have information of non-linear behavior of the physical system.
</div>


**Closed loop system schemes for variable stabilization**

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert" markdown="1" >
You have a physical variable that you want to stabilize against environment changes.
You can measure it and convert it in an electrical signal you take from RP input 1.
With Lock-in+PID you can stabilize it to a desired offset voltage value using an *error*
signal ( `error = input1 - offset` ) that feeds a PID filter. The PID output is a
*correction* signals that can be added to the *control* signal that actually
controls the physical system.

This is called a close loop scheme. If it is well designed, you can use it to make
the physical system to be *"tied"* to a particular state.
</div>


**Combined systems**

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert" markdown="1" >
Some times you can only measure the physical system that you want to stabilize
using information get by the lock-in technique. You can combine both techniques
to stabilize, for example, the phase of a system, the derivative of the response
signal or the noise-filtered amplitude of the response signal, building a lock-in
scheme whose output will be used as the *error* signal for PID input.

###  Applications tested in lab
  - Stabilization of laser wavelength to atomic transition
  - Stabilization of laser wavelength to Fabry-Perot interferometer (Pound-Drever-Hall)
  - Stabilization of VCO frequency to an electronic reference (Crystal or RCL circuit)
