Here you can find other works and versions related with this App. Most of them are
just the same application but with slight modifications.


## Harmonic Lock-in+PID (v0.3.22)

This version of the App doesn't include the square Lock-in. Thats enable some free
"physical surfece" of the FPGA to implement other features.

The new features are:
  - **Modulation added on outputs**: In the Auxiliar tab of the Lock-in instrument
    you can switch on/off the modulacion signal `cos_ref` to be added to the signal
    already choosen for each port. A `-1` value menas `off` and any other value is the
    relative amplitude respecto to `8191 int == 1 Vpp`.
  - **Enhanced amplification**: The `X` and `Y` signals can now be amplified by `x524288` (`x512k`).
    This enables the posibility to measure signals that are far below the resolution limit (~`1V/8192`)

The lower physical surface load may correct some cross-talking problems between signals that happened on some devices
in the Lock-in+PID App.

## Harmonic Lock-in+PID HF (for High Frequency)

This is a copy of the project above but with an oscillator then goes from 60 Hz to 1 MHz.

## Dummy Simulator(v0.1): A peak function simulator for testing purposes

This App simulate a peak-response from a system scanned through a control signal. You can use ir to test locking
procedures for Lock-in+PID or Harmonic Lock-in+PID App.

  * In one RedPitaya device (RP1) you use Lock-in+PID
  * In other one (RP2) you load the simulator
  * Connect RP1 `in1` to RP2 `out1` and RP1 `out1` to RP2 `in1`
  * Now you can make a Ramp-Scan from RP1. RP2 will response on `out1` as you where scaning
    an spectrum with one peak.
  * On the simulator you can see de actual input, the response of the system, and the also a copy of the peak signal
  * The App lets you configure the peak height, width, position over the ramp-scan, add white gaussian noise and a linear baseline.

The source code can be found in  [github rp_dummy_simulator repository](https://github.com/marceluda/rp_dummy_simulator).
